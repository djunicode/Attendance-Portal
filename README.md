# Attendance-Portal
Flutter application with django backend and react web frontend. 

#Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your forked repo `git clone`
3. Add the base repo as upstream `git remote add upstream {url}`
4. Make your changes and push to your(forked) repo.
5. Create a pull request from github to base repo.

To get some changes from base repo `git pull upstream`

(If some stack finds this process difficult then they can just push directly in the branch, it's okay but make sure entire stack does the same.)

There will be 4 branches

- main
- app
- backend
- frontend

_Apart from these branches above you can create as many branches as you want._

__*NOBOBY SHOULD MAKE PULL REQUEST/ PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN BRANCH.*_
